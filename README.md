# computer science conference sponsors

Curious about how the sponsors of top-tier computer conferences change over time, I manually collected sponsor information of [ACM CHI conference](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi) during 2000 - 2024. 

## Data visualizations
CHI has four major types of sponsors ranked by contributions: Hero, Champion, Contributor, and Friend. I created two Tableau dashboards to visualize the trends and compositions.
- [CHI sponsors by year](https://public.tableau.com/views/ACMCHI2000-2024sponsoranalysis/numSponsors?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
- [CHI sponsors by frequencies, with a draggable range slider of the year](https://public.tableau.com/views/SponsorsofACMCHIrankedbyfrequencies/organizations?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)


## Some findings
- Microsoft has been the most consistent sponsor for CHI, sponsoring 24 times, followed by Google (20),
NSF (20), Yahoo! (17) and Autodesk (16).
- Years with the greatest number of sponsors: 2000 (26 sponsors), perhaps due to the dot-com bubble. The most
recent peak is 2021 (18 sponsors).
- Several retired Champion sponsors: Sun microsystem (2000/2001/2002/2007), Nokia (2000) and Motorola (2000/2001)
- Only three Chinese companies have sponsored CHI: Alibaba (2018, 2019), Baidu (2019) and Huawei (2019).
- Sometimes sponsors are heavily influenced by the location, e.g., CHI'13 and CHI'15 have multiple French and Korean sponsors. 

## TODO
- [ ] Add sponsors for other conferences
